## GridFlow Certification Protocol - Initial Implementation

### Summary
This PR introduces the GridFlow Certification Protocol, a comprehensive blockchain-based certification system for renewable energy providers built on Stacks using Clarity smart contracts. The protocol establishes a robust framework for managing energy provider credentials, performance tracking, and compliance monitoring.

### Key Features Implemented

**Multi-Tier Certification System**
- 4-level certification hierarchy (Provisional → Certified → Premium → Elite)
- Automated tier progression based on performance metrics
- Flexible certification authority management

**Advanced Provider Registry**
- Comprehensive metadata storage (capacity, technology type, region)
- Expiry-based certification validity
- Compliance scoring system
- Audit trail maintenance

**Performance Monitoring Infrastructure**
- Real-time energy production tracking
- Reliability and grid stability scoring
- Carbon offset calculation
- Historical performance aggregation

**Administrative Controls**
- Secure authority transfer mechanisms
- Configurable certification parameters
- Provider suspension capabilities
- Renewal management system

### Technical Implementation

**Smart Contract Architecture**
- Gas-optimized data structures using Clarity maps
- Comprehensive error handling with descriptive error codes
- Read-only functions for public transparency
- Administrative functions with proper access control

**Security Features**
- Principal-based authorization
- Immutable audit trails
- Parameter validation
- Block-height based expiry management

### Data Models

**Provider Registry Schema**
```clarity
{
  provider-name: (string-utf8 100),
